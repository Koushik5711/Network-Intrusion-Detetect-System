# Network-Intrusion-Detetect-System
We have developed a machine learning project called Network Intrusion Detection System. For this project, We have collected data from University of South Wales, Canberra. And later we have performed Data preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Model selection and Training, and Model Evaluation.

**Through this project, we would like to address the following research questions**:-

How can machine learning algorithms be applied to analyze the UNSW-NB15 dataset and detect different types of cyber-attacks?
What are the key features and patterns indicative of malicious activities in network traffic data?
How do different machine learning models perform in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for cybersecurity threat detection?
